# NHI_NFT_Crib

## Project Overview
Welcome to the official repository for the NFT_Crib project, an innovative ecosystem that bridges the exciting world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with immersive gaming experiences. The NFT_Crib Marketplace is a cutting-edge platform for trading NFTs specifically designed to be used within the NFT_Crib gameâ€”a place where virtual assets come to life. Our platform simplifies the transition from traditional fiat currencies to cryptocurrency, enabling a seamless trading experience within the ecosystem.

## Key Features
Fiat On-Ramp Integration: Through our partnership with OnRamper, users can effortlessly buy cryptocurrency directly within the marketplace, removing the barrier to entry for those new to the digital currency space.

Deployed on Moralis Servers: Leveraging the robust backend infrastructure provided by Moralis, our marketplace offers a reliable and scalable service for our users' trading needs.

NFT Game Utility: NFTs purchased or traded within our marketplace are not just collectibles but also serve a functional role within the NFT_Crib game, enhancing the gameplay and user interaction.

## Technical Stack
The NFT_Crib project is built using a combination of modern technologies and programming languages, ensuring a secure and user-friendly experience:

JavaScript: For dynamic front-end development and interaction with blockchain-based features.

Solidity: The core smart contracts that govern the NFT transactions and rules are written in Solidity, ensuring secure and reliable operations on the blockchain.

HTML & CSS: Structuring and styling our marketplace with a responsive and intuitive design.

Moralis: A powerful Web3 development platform that provides the backend infrastructure, enabling seamless interaction with Ethereum blockchain and improving scalability.

## Limitations and Development Status
During the development process, we encountered limitations with Unity's WebGL module regarding support for Moralis and Web3 functionalities. As a result, the NFT_Crib game is not currently available to play on Unity Play. However, we are actively exploring alternatives and solutions to bring the full gaming experience to our users in the near future.
